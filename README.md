Simuletic Weapon Detection Dataset

## Overview
This is an open-source synthetic dataset for computer vision (CV) object detection tasks, focusing on people holding weapons in public areas viewed from CCTV camera perspectives. The dataset consists of high-quality, realistic synthetic images.

Key features:
- **Classes**: "person" and "weapon" (e.g., guns, knives in various poses and scenarios).
- **Annotations**: Bounding boxes (rectangles) in YOLO format for easy integration with models like YOLOv8.
- **Resolution**: Mixed resolutions.
- **Purpose**: Designed for training and evaluating AI models in security, surveillance, and threat detection. Addresses data scarcity and privacy issues with synthetic alternatives.

This dataset is a sample done by Simuletic. We are working on open sourced dataset to help with weapon and threat detection.

## Dataset Structure
- **images/**: Folder containing .jpg or .png files (e.g., image001.jpg).
- **labels/**: Folder with YOLO .txt files (one per image, e.g., image001.txt). Each line: `class_id center_x center_y width height` (normalized 0-1).
- **annotations.csv** (optional): A CSV summary with columns like image_name, class, x_min, y_min, x_max, y_max for quick reference.

Example YOLO label line:
0 0.45 0.55 0.20 0.30  # person
1 0.60 0.70 0.10 0.15  # weapon
text## Usage

Preprocess resolutions if needed (e.g., via OpenCV for resizing).

Ethics and Limitations

This is fully synthetic dataâ€”no real individuals or events are depicted.
Intended for ethical use in research/security (e.g., improving detection models). Do not use for harmful purposes.
Potential biases: Scenarios may not cover all real-world diversity; audit for fairness.
For production, combine with real data and validate.
